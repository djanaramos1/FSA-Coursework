//Create a string for the user saying You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination: 121
//Assign three variables
//create three unique arithmetic operator
//Add comments throughout the code to explain each step in the process
//Create a dialog box displaying the vault codes and the text if using HTML and a script tag, or create a popup dialog

//This code gives the user an alert when coming to the page. It is a statement and ends with a semicolon

let myVariable = 1;

//the variable is declared 1

let myV = [1, 2, 1];
console.log(myV[1]);
//This is an array and the output is 2 because, you start counting each spot starting with 0. So the 1 spot named in the console log would be the number 2 in the array

let myVar = 1;

//=== strictly equals one, making the if statement true and output 1
